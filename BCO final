        "Apoptosis is an important process for maintaining homeostasis, eliminating cells that have been damaged beyond repair, and preventing cancer. If there is a problem with apoptosis, it could lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and development of a tumor. ",
        "Proteins of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family are known to regulate programmed cell death through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. They are therefore considered pro-survival proteins given that a major characteristic of cancer is its ability to avoid programmed cell death. This makes them a therapeutic target for drug discovery. When there is intracellular stress, the apoptotic homeostasis is controlled by the activator and sensitizer BH3 (Bcl-2 homology 2)-only proteins. Changes in expression levels of these proteins can lead to an imbalance. More specifically, overexpression can cause oncogenic effects. Normally, the Bcl-2 family proteins will bind to the BH3 motif of pro-apoptotic proteins to create a network of protein-protein interactions, but any dysfunction will result in the cancer cells to evade cell death. This study emphasizes the importance of future experimental research on the protein network between Bcl-2 and BH3 within a breast cancer context.",
        "Bioinformatic approaches were done in order to link -omics with structural data. There was no change in the parameters from the default. This BCO represents the steps taken to identify protein interaction partners of the Bcl-2 family members that contain the BH3 motif in breast cancer samples. This was done by first retrieving the experimentally known Bcl-2 family interactions from the human Integrated Interaction Database (IID), and then the interaction list was filtered to only include those proteins containing the BH3 motif. Out of the 560 protein-protein interactions that were collected, 295 of them were selected as possible BH3-containing proteins. Out of the 295 proteins, 282 were identified as BH-3 only. "
